# BE-Hackathon Team Onboarding Guide

Welcome to our hackathon project! 🎉
This guide explains exactly how our team will use GitHub to collaborate without breaking each other’s code.

🚀 Project Overview

We’re building a simple app that:

Tracks macros and calories in meals

Creates meal plans based on dietary preferences (vegan, vegetarian, etc.)

Connects multiple pages (Home → Select Plans → Plan Details)

👥 Team Roles
Lauren -

Cameron	- 

Brian	- 

Harif - 

🧠 Quick Summary

Everyone works on their own branch, not main.

When your part is done → open a Pull Request (PR) → Harif will review & merge it into main.

Always pull the latest main before starting new work.

🪜 Step-by-Step Instructions

1️⃣ Accept the Invite

Check your email or GitHub notifications → accept the repo invitation.

2️⃣ Clone the Repo

Open GitHub Desktop.

Click File → Clone Repository.

Paste this link:

https://github.com/<your-username>/BE-Hackathon-


Choose a folder on your computer → click Clone.

3️⃣ Create Your Branch

Each teammate makes their own branch to keep work separated.

In GitHub Desktop:

Click Current Branch → New Branch

Name it your first name or task (e.g., Lauren, Cameron, Brian)

Click Create Branch → Publish Branch

4️⃣ Add Your Code

Open the repo in VS Code → add your files inside the correct folder:

app/
  src/
    pages/
      Home/         ←
      SelectPlans/  ← 
      PlanLinks/    ← 


Save your work regularly.

5️⃣ Commit and Push

When you finish or reach a milestone:

Go back to GitHub Desktop.

Write a short commit message like:

feat(home): add homepage layout


Click Commit to [your branch name].

Click Push origin (top bar).

6️⃣ Open a Pull Request

Go to the repo on GitHub.com.

You’ll see a yellow box at the top → click “Compare & Pull Request.”

Write a clear title + short description.

Assign Harif as the reviewer.

Click Create Pull Request.

7️⃣ Review and Merge

Harif will review and merge into main.

After merging, your code becomes part of the official app.

Don’t merge directly into main without review.

8️⃣ Update Your Local Repo

When someone else’s code is merged:

Switch to main in GitHub Desktop.

Click Fetch origin → Pull origin.

Create a new branch from the updated main for your next task.
